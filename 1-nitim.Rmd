The NITIM 2022 Summer School (**June 16th -- 18th, 2022**) will take place in Nancy,
France, just before the [28th IEEE ICE/ITMC & 31st IAMOT Conference
IEEE](https://ice-iamot-2022-conference.org/). We invite PhD candidates to submit
proposals for evaluation. For those who are in the first year of their PhD program, we
look forward to receiving a research proposal. For those in their late stage of their
Ph.D., you are encouraged to submit a relevant piece for your research (a paper, an
overview, or a chapter of your PhD thesis).

The admission to the school will be based on the review of the extended abstracts
([download
template](https://ice-iamot-2022-conference.org/assets/nitim/Template_Extended_Abstract-NITIM2022.docx))
which should be sent by email to
[**nitim.contact\@gmail.com**](mailto:nitim.contact@gmail.com){.email}. The deadline for
submission of the Extended Abstract is ~~February 18th~~**March 3rd** (midnight CET).
Notification of acceptance of the school will be sent by **March 11th** in order to
facilitate the early booking of flights and accommodation. The full proposal (or paper),
which will form the basis of the discussion and feedback at the Summer School, is due by
**May 2nd**.

The NITIM Schools facilitate the development of doctoral research in the interdisciplinary
field of Networks, Information, Technology and Innovation Management, bringing together
PhD candidates and faculty members in a focused, in-depth, and constructive discussion of
the candidates' research work. The summer school is affiliated to the IEEE ICE/ITMC
conference, and for 2022 will be a joint event between IEEE ICE/ITMC and IAMOT
communities.
