This Summer School is organized once a year in cooperation with the ICE/IEEE ITMC Conference and thus takes place at changing locations – e.g. 2016 in Trondheim (Norway), 2017 in Madeira (Portugal) and 2018 in Konstanz (Germany), in 2019 in Nice (France), and online in 2020 and 2021. **In June 2022, the Summer School will also be a joint event with IAMOT Community, and will take place in Nancy (France).** 



The NITIM Graduate Summer School is an international PhD school that focuses on topics in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation and technology management as well as information and communication technologies. 
The NITIM Schools facilitate the development of doctoral research in the interdisciplinary field of Networks, Information, Technology and Innovation Management, bringing together PhD candidates and faculty members in a focused, in-depth, and constructive discussion of the candidates’ research work.

Furthermore, the NITIM School is all about a community. This PhD consortia is the opportunity to meet a great group of people who is open to share their ideas, knowledge and experiences. Network members include PhD candidates, alumni, faculty and industry partners in over 10 countries around the world, representing over 20 nationalities.



>**We invite PhD candidates to submit proposals for evaluation and we invite faculty members to join us.**.
