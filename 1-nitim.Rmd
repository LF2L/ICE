This Summer School is organized once a year in cooperation with the ICE/IEEE ITMC Conference and thus takes place at changing locations – e.g. 2016 in Trondheim (Norway), 2017 in Madeira (Portugal) and 2018 in
Konstanz (Germany). In 2019 in Nice, France.


The NITIM Graduate Summer School is an international PhD school that focuses on topics in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation and technology management as well as information and communication technologies. 
The NITIM Schools facilitate the development of doctoral research in the interdisciplinary field of Networks, Information, Technology and Innovation Management, bringing together PhD candidates and faculty members in a focused, in-depth, and constructive discussion of the candidates’ research work.

Furthermore, the NITIM Schools is all about a community. 
This PhD consortia is the opportunity to meet a great group of people who is open to share their ideas, knowledge and experiences. Network members include PhD candidates, alumni, faculty and industry partners in over 10 countries around the world, representing over 20 nationalities.



>**We invite PhD candidates to submit proposals for evaluation and we invite faculty members to join us**. 

The core of the Summer School will be group sessions of 3 PhD candidates and 2 faculty members.

For those who have just started their PhD program, we look forward to receiving a research proposal. 
For those in their late stage of their Ph.D., you are encouraged to submit a relevant piece for your research (a paper, an overview, or a chapter of your PhD thesis).

The admission to the school will be based on the fit of the full proposal (or paper) with the topic of the school and, once the fit is there, with the review of the proposal (or paper). 
The proposal/paper will form the basis of the discussion and feedback at the Virtual Summer School, and is due by **XX XXth/2021**. 

Notification of acceptance to the school will be sent by **XX YYth**.

After completion of the Summer School and a short learning report to be submitted within 2 weeks after NITIM, PhD candidates can receive a certificate.
