      "contents": "\nICE is the International Conference on Engineering, Technology, and\nInnovation. It developed from an early focus on the engineering method\nof concurrent engineering, to general organization of the engineering\nprocess and its organization within the corporation and in networks.\nConcurrency obviously addresses parallelisation of activities in time,\nbut it comes with the broadening of decision making on what is wanted\nand how services and products ought to be. This is not decided by\ntechnical criteria alone, but includes usability, economic,\nenvironmental, and social criteria. The ICE conference therefore\ndiscusses systems engineering as a socio-technical task with a focus on\ndesign of products and services, and the entrepreneurial innovation\nprocess for its adoption in society and economy.\nA proud history of ICE events:\nICE 1994 organized by Dr. Marc Pallot in Sophia Antipolis,\nFrance\nICE 1995 organized by Prof. Dr. Petri Pulli, Dr. Lars Bergman &\nDr. Marc Pallot in Stockholm, Sweden\nICE 1996 organized by Bruno Lisanti & Roberto Santoro in Milan,\nItaly\nICE 1997 organized by Prof. Dr. Kulwant Pawar in Nottingham, UK\nICE 1999 organized by Kees Hof & Neil Wognum in The Hague, The\nNetherlands – “5 Years Anniversary”\nICE 2000 organized by Olivier Rérolles & Dr. Marc Pallot in\nToulouse, France\nICE 2001 organized by Prof. Dr. Klaus-Dieter Thoben &\nDr. Frithjof Weber in Bremen, Germany\nICE 2002 organized by Marco Conté & Roberto Santoro in Rome,\nItaly\nICE 2003 organized by Dr. Abdul Samad (Sami) Katzy in Espoo,\nFinland\nICE 2004 organized by Prof. Dr. Fernando Guerrero in Sevilla, Spain\n– “10 Years Anniversary”\nICE 2005 organized by Prof. Dr. Bernhard Katzy in Munich,\nGermany\nICE 2006 organized by Prof. Dr. Marco Taisch & Dr. Sergio Terzi\nin Milan, Italy\nICE 2007 organized by Dr. Marc Pallot, Dr. Alain Zarli &\nDr. Servane Crave in Sophia Antipolis, France\nICE 2008 organized by Prof. Dr. Ricardo Goncalves in Lisbon,\nPortugal\nICE 2009 organized by Robert Bierwolf in Leiden, Huis Ter Duin, The\nNetherlands – “15 Years Anniversary”\nICE 2010 organized by Prof. Dr. Claudio Boer & Dr. Luca Canetta\nin Lugano, Switzerland\nICE 2011 organized by Prof. Dr. Volker Stich & Prof. Dr. Gerhard\nGudergan in Aachen, Germany\nICE 2012 organized by Prof. Dr. Klaus Sailer & Dr. Thomas\nHolzmann in Munich, Germany\nICE 2013 organized by Prof. Dr. Roland Ortt & Scott Cunningham\nin The Hague, The Netherlands\nICE 2014 organized by Prof. Dr. Sergio Terzi in Bergamo, Italy – “20\nYears Anniversary”\nICE 2015 organized by Dr. Brendan Galbraith in Belfast, Northern\nIreland\nICE 2016 organized by Prof. Dr. Pekka Abrahamsson & Dr. Kjetil\nKristensen in Trondheim, Norway\nICE 2017 organized by Prof. Dr. Ricardo Goncalves in Madeira Island,\nPortugal\nICE 2018 organized by Marc König & Prof. Dr. Guido Baltes in\nStuttgart, Germany\nICE 2019 organized by Dr. Marc Pallot & Dr. Alain Zarli in\nSophia Antipolis, France – “ICE 25th Anniversary”\nICE 2020 organized by Professor Yacine Rezgui – Organised online due\nto COVID-19 – “ICE 25th Anniversary”\nICE 2021 organized by Prof. Yacine Rezgui in Cardiff, UK\nThis year ICE 2022 will take place in Nancy, France.\nThe ICE IEEE/ITMC 2021 would like to invite our growing community of\nresearchers, innovators, industrialists, engineers and practitioners to\nshare their insights, practices, projects and case studies that address\nthe conference theme\n\n“Technology, Engineering, and Innovation Management\nCommunities as Enablers for Social-Ecological\nTransitions”\n\nFollow us on: @ICE_Conference\n\n\n\n",

Conversely, the increasing frequency of\nclimate-related disasters are posing challenging problems to local and\nnational authorities, with a potentially wider impact. It is becoming\nessential to comprehend ways in which socio-technical systems respond to\nuncertainty.\nThe latter tends to be multi-faceted and involve dynamic and\ntime-dependent phenomena.\nResilience research has mainly focussed on the capacity of a\nsocio-technical system to absorb shocks, perturbations and stressors,\nand to recover to its pre-disturbance state. Innovation, Technology, and\nEngineering Management research is needed to progress the body of\nknowledge in the resilience field, to pave the way to socio-technical\nsystems that learn and improve from their past disturbances, while\ncontinuously minimizing the recovery stage.
