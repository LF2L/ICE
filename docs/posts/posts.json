This means that all accepted research could be presented either in person or remotely. In any case, whatever the situation next June, we are sure that our dynamic communities will have a dedicated space to exchange and discuss how engineering, innovation and technology management could significantly contribute to address the challenges our society is facing today.\nThank you very much for your understanding and support,\nThe Organizing Committee Chair, Pr. Laure Morel, Pr. Mauricio Camargo, Dr.Â Laurent Dupont\n\n\n\n",
