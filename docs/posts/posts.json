Instead, the uncertainties and continuous contingencies, resulting from the pandemic evolution, we are still working hard to ensure a valuable and insightful ICE-IAMOT conference 2022.\nTo answer some questions from the communities’ members regarding the on-line participation, let us remain you that since the beginning we considered the conference as a hybrid event. Meaning that all the accepted research works could be presented either in person or on a distance basis.\nIn any case, no matter what the situation will be next June, we’re sure our vibrant communities will have a dedicated space to exchange and discuss how engineering, innovation, and Management of Technology could make significant contributions to undertake the challenges our society is facing today.\nThanks a lot for your comprehension and support,\nBest regards,\nThe Organizing Committee Chair, Pr. Laure Morel, Pr. Mauricio Camargo, Dr. Laurent Dupont\n\n\n\n",
