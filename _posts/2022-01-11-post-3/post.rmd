**Dear ICE-IAMOT Community members**, 
 
First of all, we wish you all the best for this new year, health, happiness, and wonderful surprises.

Despite the ongoing uncertainties and contingencies resulting from the evolving pandemic, we continue to work hard to ensure a quality and informative ICE-IAMOT 2022 conference.

To address some of the questions from community members regarding online participation, we remind you that from the beginning we have considered the conference a hybrid event.
This means that all accepted research could be presented either in person or remotely.
In any case, whatever the situation next June, we are sure that our dynamic communities will have a dedicated space to exchange and discuss how engineering, innovation and technology management could significantly contribute to address the challenges our society is facing today.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support,

The Organizing Committee Chair,<br>
Pr. Laure Morel,  Pr. Mauricio Camargo, Dr. Laurent Dupont
